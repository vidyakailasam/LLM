The ArticleBot is a research tool that allows users to easily retrieve relevant information from news/business articles. It uses LangChain to process article text and OpenAI embeddings with FAISS for fast similarity search. 

Process:
1. Load article URLs or text files to fetch content
2. Use LangChain UnstructuredURL Loader to process text
3. Generate OpenAI embeddings and index with FAISS for swift retrieval
4. Interact by asking questions and getting answers with source URLs

The project uses Streamlit for the web interface. Users can input URLs, process them, and the Bot will index the embeddings for fast retrieval. Questions can then be asked to receive insightful answers extracted from the loaded articles.
